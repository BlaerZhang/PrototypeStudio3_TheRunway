操，我好像把眼罩落在飞机上了
行李出来得也太慢了，本来还想在这睡会儿，现在好了，眼罩也没了

-要不是老板抠门，出差也不至于坐红眼航班遭罪了

明年再不涨工资，这日子也快过不下去了
天天上班日子也没个盼头，生活什么时候才能好起来啊
诶？好像出来的？你的行李是哪个来着

-好像那个是...什么？



今天终于可以好好爽一下了
干杯！为了我们的升职加薪！

-干杯！争取早日成为中产阶级！

这次涨完工资，咱已经是中产阶级了吧？

-那就争取早日成为上层阶级！世界各地到处飞，看F1，吃米其林，逛时装周！

那今天怎么说也得吃点真中产阶级吃的东西啊
咱要不来个最贵的那个？我看下菜单
Otoro?拿一份尝尝吧，是哪个来着？

-感觉...应该是...那个吧？



怎么样，这个时装周牛逼吧？

-真是目不暇接！

5年前的愿望总算是实现了！好爽，怎么样，开心吗？

-我...我不知道，应该是开心的吧

什么叫应该！是不是光看还不够饱眼福？
这样！你看中哪套和我说，我送你！
随便选！



嘿，发什么楞呢

-nothing


Shit, I think I left my blindfold on the plane.
Those luggages comes out too slow. I can even take a nap here, but now I've lost my blindfold.

-If it wasn't for our stingy boss, we wouldn't have to suffer on a red-eye flight.

If we don't get a raise next year, how can we make a living?
Working every day with no hope. Is this life even getting better?
Eh? Looks like your luggage coming out? Which one is yours?

-I think it's... what?



Finally having a good time today.
Cheers! To our promotion and raise!

-Cheers! To becoming mid-class soon!

Wait, we can already be count as mid-class after the raise, right?

-Yeah, you're right. Then To becoming upper class soon! Living a life flying around the world, watching Formula 1,  , going to fashion week!

Then we shoud taste some genuine mid-class cuisine today.
Why don't we go for the most expensive one? Let me check the menu.
Otoro? Let's try one of these. but wait, Which one is otoro?

-I think it's... That one?



How's that? Isn't this show great?

-What a sight to behold!

Our wish from 5 years ago has finally come true! Did you have fun?

-I don't know. I...yeah. I think so.

"You think so"? Isn't it enough just to watch?
Here's the deal! Tell me which outfit you like, I'll buy it for you!
Take your pick!



Hey, what's wrong with you?

-Nothing.
